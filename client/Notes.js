/*
    Object: Navbar with react
    . In navbar page will not reload cuz we are calling one of its component and this is SPA
    . Component = If same piece of code we use every where we make component of it in a place and pass the reference where we need it
      e.g. Navbar, Footer etc
    . React is all about components
    . For components we use pascal conventions first letter capital. e.g. SetItem, GetItem
    . When making any component we have to use flat arrow fucntion
    . If we want to use the comonents every where we can either pass the reference to top of every component or we can pass it in BrowserRouter
